# NMFD-GNN (Network Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram - Graph Neural Network)
A physics-informed machine learning model for traffic state imputation.

## Introduction
* Traffic state imputation (TSI) refers to the estimation of missing values of traffic variables, such as flow rate and traffic density, using available data.
* Despite these advantages, purely data-driven models have limitations. For example, they lack traffic engineering-related interpretations. The parameters of the learned neural network model can be messy with positive and negative values without physical meaning, making the model a black box to transportation researchers.
* This study proposes NMFD-GNN, a physics-informed machine learning (PIML) model that fuses the NMFD with the GNN to perform network-wide TSI. 
* Our proposed NMFD-GNN model and its variant, NMFD-GNN-HINGE, are evaluated on road networks located in Zurich and London from the UTD19 dataset (https://utd19.ethz.ch/).
